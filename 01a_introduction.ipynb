John should find home a\\r\\nparadise, he should always see a smiling face, should fare sumptuously\\r\\nevery day, and never know the loss of a button.  She brought so much\\r\\nlove, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but\\r\\nsucceed, in spite of some obstacles.  Her paradise was not a tranquil\\r\\none, for the little woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and\\r\\nbustled about like a true Martha, cumbered with many cares.  She was\\r\\ntoo tired, sometimes, even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after a course\\r\\nof dainty dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare.  As for buttons,\\r\\nshe soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her head over the\\r\\ncarelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them on himself,\\r\\nand see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy fingers any better\\r\\nthan hers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were very happy, even after they discovered that they couldn't\\r\\nlive on love alone.  John did not find Meg's beauty diminished, though\\r\\nshe beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot.  Nor did Meg\\r\\nmiss any of the romance from the daily parting, when her husband\\r\\nfollowed up his kiss with the tender inquiry, \\\"Shall I send some veal\\r\\nor mutton for dinner, darling?\\\" The little house ceased to be a\\r\\nglorified bower, but it became a home, and the young couple soon felt\\r\\nthat it was a change for the better.  At first they played keep-house,\\r\\nand frolicked over it like children.  Then John took steadily to\\r\\nbusiness, feeling the cares of the head of a family upon his shoulders,\\r\\nand Meg laid by her cambric wrappers, put on a big apron, and fell to\\r\\nwork, as before said, with more energy than discretion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius's\\r\\nReceipt Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the\\r\\nproblems with patience and care.  Sometimes her family were invited in\\r\\nto help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be\\r\\nprivately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be\\r\\nconcealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little\\r\\nHummels.  An evening with John over the account books usually produced\\r\\na temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would\\r\\nensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread\\r\\npudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although\\r\\nhe bore it with praiseworthy fortitude.  Before the golden mean was\\r\\nfound, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what young\\r\\ncouples seldom get on long without, a family jar.\\r\\n\\r\\nFired a with housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with\\r\\nhomemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. John\\r\\nwas requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an extra\\r\\nquantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were to be\\r\\nattended to at once.  As John firmly believed that 'my wife' was equal\\r\\nto anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he resolved that\\r\\nshe should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit laid by in a most\\r\\npleasing form for winter use.  Home came four dozen delightful little\\r\\npots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for\\r\\nher.  With her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the\\r\\nelbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the\\r\\nbib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her\\r\\nsuccess, for hadn't she seen Hannah do it hundreds of times?  The array\\r\\nof pots rather amazed her at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and\\r\\nthe nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg\\r\\nresolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling,\\r\\nstraining, and fussing over her jelly.  She did her best, she asked\\r\\nadvice of Mrs. Cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what Hannah\\r\\ndid that she left undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but\\r\\nthat dreadful stuff wouldn't 'jell'.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her a hand,\\r\\nbut John and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with\\r\\ntheir private worries, experiments, or quarrels.  They had laughed over\\r\\nthat last word as if the idea it suggested was a most preposterous one,\\r\\nbut they had held to their resolve, and whenever they could get on\\r\\nwithout help they did so, and no one interfered, for Mrs. March had\\r\\nadvised the plan.  So Meg wrestled alone with the refractory sweetmeats\\r\\nall that hot summer day, and at five o'clock sat down in her\\r\\ntopsy-turvey kitchen, wrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and\\r\\nwept.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said, \\\"My\\r\\nhusband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever he\\r\\nlikes.  I shall always be prepared.  There shall be no flurry, no\\r\\nscolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a good\\r\\ndinner.  John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom you\\r\\nplease, and be sure of a welcome from me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHow charming that was, to be sure!  John quite glowed with pride to\\r\\nhear her say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to have a\\r\\nsuperior wife.  But, although they had had company from time to time,\\r\\nit never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had an\\r\\nopportunity to distinguish herself till now.  It always happens so in\\r\\nthis vale of tears, there is an inevitability about such things which\\r\\nwe can only wonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would have\\r\\nbeen unpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days in the\\r\\nyear, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly.  Congratulating\\r\\nhimself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning, feeling\\r\\nsure that it would be ready to the minute, and indulging in pleasant\\r\\nanticipations of the charming effect it would produce, when his pretty\\r\\nwife came running out to meet him, he escorted his friend to his\\r\\nmansion, with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host and\\r\\nhusband.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he reached\\r\\nthe Dovecote.  The front door usually stood hospitably open. Now it was\\r\\nnot only shut, but locked, and yesterday's mud still adorned the steps.\\r\\nThe parlor windows were closed and curtained, no picture of the pretty\\r\\nwife sewing on the piazza, in white, with a distracting little bow in\\r\\nher hair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy welcome as she\\r\\ngreeted her guest.  Nothing of the sort, for not a soul appeared but a\\r\\nsanginary-looking boy asleep under the current bushes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm afraid something has happened.  Step into the garden, Scott, while\\r\\nI look up Mrs. Brooke,\\\" said John, alarmed at the silence and solitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nRound the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned sugar, and\\r\\nMr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his face.  He paused\\r\\ndiscreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared, but he could both see\\r\\nand hear, and being a bachelor, enjoyed the prospect mightily.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the kitchen reigned confusion and despair.  One edition of jelly was\\r\\ntrickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor, and a third was\\r\\nburning gaily on the stove.  Lotty, with Teutonic phlegm, was calmly\\r\\neating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was still in a hopelessly\\r\\nliquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her apron over her head, sat\\r\\nsobbing dismally.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"My dearest girl, what is the matter?\\\" cried John, rushing in, with\\r\\nawful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and secret\\r\\nconsternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, John, I am so tired and hot and cross and worried!  I've been at\\r\\nit till I'm all worn out.  Do come and help me or I shall die!\\\" and the\\r\\nexhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast, giving him a sweet\\r\\nwelcome in every sense of the word, for her pinafore had been baptized\\r\\nat the same time as the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"What worries you dear?  Has anything dreadful happened?\\\" asked the\\r\\nanxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little cap, which was\\r\\nall askew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" sobbed Meg despairingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Tell me quick, then.  Don't cry.  I can bear anything better than\\r\\nthat.  Out with it, love.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"The... The jelly won't jell and I don't know what to do!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward, and the\\r\\nderisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal, which\\r\\nput the finishing stroke to poor Meg's woe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Is that all?  Fling it out of the window, and don't bother any more\\r\\nabout it.  I'll buy you quarts if you want it, but for heaven's sake\\r\\ndon't have hysterics, for I've brought Jack Scott home to dinner,\\r\\nand...\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands with a\\r\\ntragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a tone of\\r\\nmingled indignation, reproach, and dismay...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"A man to dinner, and everything in a mess!  John Brooke, how could you\\r\\ndo such a thing?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Hush, he's in the garden!  I forgot the confounded jelly, but it can't\\r\\nbe helped now,\\\" said John, surveying the prospect with an anxious eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you ought to\\r\\nhave remembered how busy I was,\\\" continued Meg petulantly, for even\\r\\nturtledoves will peck when ruffled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I didn't know it this morning, and there was no time to send word, for\\r\\nI met him on the way out.  I never thought of asking leave, when you\\r\\nhave always told me to do as I liked.  I never tried it before, and\\r\\nhang me if I ever do again!\\\" added John, with an aggrieved air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I should hope not!  Take him away at once.  I can't see him, and there\\r\\nisn't any dinner.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, I like that!  Where's the beef and vegetables I sent home, and\\r\\nthe pudding you promised?\\\" cried John, rushing to the larder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I hadn't time to cook anything.  I meant to dine at Mother's. I'm\\r\\nsorry, but I was so busy,\\\" and Meg's tears began again.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn was a mild man, but he was human, and after a long day's work to\\r\\ncome home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic house, an empty\\r\\ntable, and a cross wife was not exactly conducive to repose of mind or\\r\\nmanner.  He restrained himself however, and the little squall would\\r\\nhave blown over, but for one unlucky word.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It's a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, we'll pull\\r\\nthrough and have a good time yet.  Don't cry, dear, but just exert\\r\\nyourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat.  We're both as hungry\\r\\nas hunters, so we shan't mind what it is.  Give us the cold meat, and\\r\\nbread and cheese.  We won't ask for jelly.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed his\\r\\nfate.  Meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure, and\\r\\nthe last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can.  I'm too used up\\r\\nto 'exert' myself for anyone.  It's like a man to propose a bone and\\r\\nvulgar bread and cheese for company.  I won't have anything of the sort\\r\\nin my house.  Take that Scott up to Mother's, and tell him I'm away,\\r\\nsick, dead, anything.  I won't see him, and you two can laugh at me and\\r\\nmy jelly as much as you like.  You won't have anything else here.\\\"  and\\r\\nhaving delivered her defiance all on one breath, Meg cast away her\\r\\npinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew, but Mr.\\r\\nScott was not taken 'up to Mother's', and when Meg descended, after\\r\\nthey had strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous\\r\\nlunch which filled her with horror.  Lotty reported that they had eaten\\r\\n\\\"a much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all the\\r\\nsweet stuff, and hide the pots.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeg longed to go and tell Mother, but a sense of shame at her own\\r\\nshort-comings, of loyalty to John, \\\"who might be cruel, but nobody\\r\\nshould know it,\\\" restrained her, and after a summary cleaning up, she\\r\\ndressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to come and be\\r\\nforgiven.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, John didn't come, not seeing the matter in that light.\\r\\nHe had carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused his little\\r\\nwife as well as he could, and played the host so hospitably that his\\r\\nfriend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come again, but\\r\\nJohn was angry, though he did not show it, he felt that Meg had\\r\\ndeserted him in his hour of need.  \\\"It wasn't fair to tell a man to\\r\\nbring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when he took you\\r\\nat your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him in the lurch, to\\r\\nbe laughed at or pitied.  No, by George, it wasn't! And Meg must know\\r\\nit.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was over\\r\\nand he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood came over\\r\\nhim.  \\\"Poor little thing!  It was hard upon her when she tried so\\r\\nheartily to please me.  She was wrong, of course, but then she was\\r\\nyoung.  I must be patient and teach her.\\\"  He hoped she had not gone\\r\\nhome--he hated gossip and interference.  For a minute he was ruffled\\r\\nagain at the mere thought of it, and then the fear that Meg would cry\\r\\nherself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace,\\r\\nresolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her where\\r\\nshe had failed in her duty to her spouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeg likewise resolved to be 'calm and kind, but firm', and show him his\\r\\nduty.  She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed and\\r\\ncomforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, she did nothing of\\r\\nthe sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum quite naturally,\\r\\nas she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her best parlor.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but feeling\\r\\nthat his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, only came\\r\\nleisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly\\r\\nrelevant remark, \\\"We are going to have a new moon, my dear.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I've no objection,\\\" was Meg's equally soothing remark.  A few other\\r\\ntopics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and\\r\\nwet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished.  John went\\r\\nto one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,\\r\\nfiguratively speaking.  Meg went to the other window, and sewed as if\\r\\nnew rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life. Neither\\r\\nspoke.  Both looked quite 'calm and firm', and both felt desperately\\r\\nuncomfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Oh, dear,\\\" thought Meg, \\\"married life is very trying, and does need\\r\\ninfinite patience as well as love, as Mother says.\\\"  The word 'Mother'\\r\\nsuggested other maternal counsels given long ago, and received with\\r\\nunbelieving protests.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn to see\\r\\nand bear with them, remembering your own.  He is very decided, but\\r\\nnever will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently.\\r\\nHe is very accurate, and particular about the truth--a good trait,\\r\\nthough you call him 'fussy'. Never deceive him by look or word, Meg,\\r\\nand he will give you the confidence you deserve, the support you need.\\r\\nHe has a temper, not like ours--one flash and then all over--but the\\r\\nwhite, still anger that is seldom stirred, but once kindled is hard to\\r\\nquench.  Be careful, be very careful, not to wake his anger against\\r\\nyourself, for peace and happiness depend on keeping his respect.  Watch\\r\\nyourself, be the first to ask pardon if you both err, and guard against\\r\\nthe little piques, misunderstandings, and hasty words that often pave\\r\\nthe way for bitter sorrow and regret.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThese words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,\\r\\nespecially the last.  This was the first serious disagreement, her own\\r\\nhasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her\\r\\nown anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John coming home to\\r\\nsuch a scene quite melted her heart.  She glanced at him with tears in\\r\\nher eyes, but he did not see them.  She put down her work and got up,\\r\\nthinking, \\\"I will be the first to say, 'Forgive me'\\\", but he did not\\r\\nseem to hear her.  She went very slowly across the room, for pride was\\r\\nhard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn his head.  For a\\r\\nminute she felt as if she really couldn't do it, then came the thought,\\r\\n\\\"This is the beginning. I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach\\r\\nmyself with,\\\" and stooping down, she softly kissed her husband on the\\r\\nforehead. Of course that settled it.  The penitent kiss was better than\\r\\na world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying\\r\\ntenderly...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. Forgive me,\\r\\ndear.  I never will again!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did Meg, both\\r\\ndeclaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made, for family\\r\\npeace was preserved in that little family jar.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation, and\\r\\nserved him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the first\\r\\ncourse, on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and made\\r\\neverything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he was a\\r\\nlucky fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood all\\r\\nthe way home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg.  Sallie Moffat\\r\\nrenewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at\\r\\nthe little house, or inviting 'that poor dear' to come in and spend the\\r\\nday at the big house.  It was pleasant, for in dull weather Meg often\\r\\nfelt lonely.  All were busy at home, John absent till night, and\\r\\nnothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about.  So it naturally fell\\r\\nout that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend.\\r\\nSeeing Sallie's pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself\\r\\nbecause she had not got them.  Sallie was very kind, and often offered\\r\\nher the coveted trifles, but Meg declined them, knowing that John\\r\\nwouldn't like it, and then this foolish little woman went and did what\\r\\nJohn disliked even worse.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe knew her husband's income, and she loved to feel that he trusted\\r\\nher, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to value\\r\\nmore--his money.  She knew where it was, was free to take what she\\r\\nliked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every\\r\\npenny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man's\\r\\nwife.  Till now she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept her\\r\\nlittle account books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without\\r\\nfear.  But that autumn the serpent got into Meg's paradise, and tempted\\r\\nher like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress.  Meg\\r\\ndidn't like to be pitied and made to feel poor.  It irritated her, but\\r\\nshe was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she tried to console\\r\\nherself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn't think she\\r\\nhad to economize.  She always felt wicked after it, for the pretty\\r\\nthings were seldom necessaries, but then they cost so little, it wasn't\\r\\nworth worrying about, so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in\\r\\nthe shopping excursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she cast up\\r\\nher accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather scared her.\\r\\nJohn was busy that month and left the bills to her, the next month he\\r\\nwas absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly settling up, and Meg\\r\\nnever forgot it.  A few days before she had done a dreadful thing, and\\r\\nit weighed upon her conscience.  Sallie had been buying silks, and Meg\\r\\nlonged for a new one, just a handsome light one for parties, her black\\r\\nsilk was so common, and thin things for evening wear were only proper\\r\\nfor girls.  Aunt March usually gave the sisters a present of\\r\\ntwenty-five dollars apiece at New Year's.  That was only a month to\\r\\nwait, and here was a lovely violet silk going at a bargain, and she had\\r\\nthe money, if she only dared to take it.  John always said what was his\\r\\nwas hers, but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective\\r\\nfive-and-twenty, but another five-and-twenty out of the household fund?\\r\\nThat was the question. Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to\\r\\nlend the money, and with the best intentions in life had tempted Meg\\r\\nbeyond her strength. In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely,\\r\\nshimmering folds, and said, \\\"A bargain, I assure, you, ma'am.\\\" She\\r\\nanswered, \\\"I'll take it,\\\" and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie\\r\\nhad exulted, and she had laughed as if it were a thing of no\\r\\nconsequence, and driven away, feeling as if she had stolen something,\\r\\nand the police were after her.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse by\\r\\nspreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now, didn't\\r\\nbecome her, after all, and the words 'fifty dollars' seemed stamped\\r\\nlike a pattern down each breadth.  She put it away, but it haunted her,\\r\\nnot delightfully as a new dress should, but dreadfully like the ghost\\r\\nof a folly that was not easily laid.  When John got out his books that\\r\\nnight, Meg's heart sank, and for the first time in her married life,\\r\\nshe was afraid of her husband.  The kind, brown eyes looked as if they\\r\\ncould be stern, and though he was unusually merry, she fancied he had\\r\\nfound her out, but didn't mean to let her know it.  The house bills\\r\\nwere all paid, the books all in order. John had praised her, and was\\r\\nundoing the old pocketbook which they called the 'bank', when Meg,\\r\\nknowing that it was quite empty, stopped his hand, saying nervously...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You haven't seen my private expense book yet.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn never asked to see it, but she always insisted on his doing so,\\r\\nand used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women\\r\\nwanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiercely the meaning\\r\\nof a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing composed of three\\r\\nrosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a\\r\\nbonnet, and cost six dollars.  That night he looked as if he would like\\r\\nthe fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her\\r\\nextravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of his prudent\\r\\nwife.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him. Meg\\r\\ngot behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles out of\\r\\nhis tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her panic\\r\\nincreasing with every word...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"John, dear, I'm ashamed to show you my book, for I've really been\\r\\ndreadfully extravagant lately.  I go about so much I must have things,\\r\\nyou know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did, and my New Year's\\r\\nmoney will partly pay for it, but I was sorry after I had done it, for\\r\\nI knew you'd think it wrong in me.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying goodhumoredly,\\r\\n\\\"Don't go and hide.  I won't beat you if you have got a pair of killing\\r\\nboots.  I'm rather proud of my wife's feet, and don't mind if she does\\r\\npay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if they are good ones.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat had been one of her last 'trifles', and John's eye had fallen on\\r\\nit as he spoke.  \\\"Oh, what will he say when he comes to that awful\\r\\nfifty dollars!\\\" thought Meg, with a shiver.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It's worse than boots, it's a silk dress,\\\" she said, with the calmness\\r\\nof desperation, for she wanted the worst over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, dear, what is the 'dem'd total', as Mr. Mantalini says?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThat didn't sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at her with\\r\\nthe straightforward look that she had always been ready to meet and\\r\\nanswer with one as frank till now.  She turned the page and her head at\\r\\nthe same time, pointing to the sum which would have been bad enough\\r\\nwithout the fifty, but which was appalling to her with that added.  For\\r\\na minute the room was very still, then John said slowly--but she could\\r\\nfeel it cost him an effort to express no displeasure--. . .\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well, I don't know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the\\r\\nfurbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It isn't made or trimmed,\\\" sighed Meg, faintly, for a sudden\\r\\nrecollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small woman,\\r\\nbut I've no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat's when she\\r\\ngets it on,\\\" said John dryly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I know you are angry, John, but I can't help it.  I don't mean to\\r\\nwaste your money, and I didn't think those little things would count up\\r\\nso.  I can't resist them when I see Sallie buying all she wants, and\\r\\npitying me because I don't.  I try to be contented, but it is hard, and\\r\\nI'm tired of being poor.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear them, but\\r\\nhe did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied himself many\\r\\npleasures for Meg's sake.  She could have bitten her tongue out the\\r\\nminute she had said it, for John pushed the books away and got up,\\r\\nsaying with a little quiver in his voice, \\\"I was afraid of this.  I do\\r\\nmy best, Meg.\\\"  If he had scolded her, or even shaken her, it would not\\r\\nhave broken her heart like those few words.  She ran to him and held\\r\\nhim close, crying, with repentant tears, \\\"Oh, John, my dear, kind,\\r\\nhard-working boy.  I didn't mean it!  It was so wicked, so untrue and\\r\\nungrateful, how could I say it! Oh, how could I say it!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one reproach,\\r\\nbut Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which would not be\\r\\nforgotten soon, although he might never allude to it again.  She had\\r\\npromised to love him for better or worse, and then she, his wife, had\\r\\nreproached him with his poverty, after spending his earnings\\r\\nrecklessly.  It was dreadful, and the worst of it was John went on so\\r\\nquietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened, except that he\\r\\nstayed in town later, and worked at night when she had gone to cry\\r\\nherself to sleep.  A week of remorse nearly made Meg sick, and the\\r\\ndiscovery that John had countermanded the order for his new greatcoat\\r\\nreduced her to a state of despair which was pathetic to behold.  He had\\r\\nsimply said, in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change, \\\"I\\r\\ncan't afford it, my dear.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMeg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the hall with\\r\\nher face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her heart would\\r\\nbreak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her husband\\r\\nbetter for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a man of him,\\r\\ngiven him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him\\r\\na tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings\\r\\nand failures of those he loved.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told the\\r\\ntruth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor.  The good-natured Mrs.\\r\\nMoffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present\\r\\nof it immediately afterward.  Then Meg ordered home the greatcoat, and\\r\\nwhen John arrived, she put it on, and asked him how he liked her new\\r\\nsilk gown.  One can imagine what answer he made, how he received his\\r\\npresent, and what a blissful state of things ensued.  John came home\\r\\nearly, Meg gadded no more, and that greatcoat was put on in the morning\\r\\nby a very happy husband, and taken off at night by a most devoted\\r\\nlittle wife.  So the year rolled round, and at midsummer there came to\\r\\nMeg a new experience, the deepest and tenderest of a woman's life.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote one Saturday,\\r\\nwith an excited face, and was received with the clash of cymbals, for\\r\\nHannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the\\r\\nother.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"How's the little mamma?  Where is everybody?  Why didn't you tell me\\r\\nbefore I came home?\\\" began Laurie in a loud whisper.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Happy as a queen, the dear!  Every soul of 'em is upstairs a\\r\\nworshipin'.  We didn't want no hurrycanes round.  Now you go into the\\r\\nparlor, and I'll send 'em down to you,\\\" with which somewhat involved\\r\\nreply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon\\r\\na large pillow.  Jo's face was very sober, but her eyes twinkled, and\\r\\nthere was an odd sound in her voice of repressed emotion of some sort.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Shut your eyes and hold out your arms,\\\" she said invitingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands behind him\\r\\nwith an imploring gesture.  \\\"No, thank you.  I'd rather not.  I shall\\r\\ndrop it or smash it, as sure as fate.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Then you shan't see your nevvy,\\\" said Jo decidedly, turning as if to\\r\\ngo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I will, I will!  Only you must be responsible for damages.\\\" and\\r\\nobeying orders, Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put\\r\\ninto his arms.  A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy, Mrs. March, Hannah,\\r\\nand John caused him to open them the next minute, to find himself\\r\\ninvested with two babies instead of one.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll enough\\r\\nto convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from the\\r\\nunconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that\\r\\nJo sat down on the floor and screamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Twins, by Jupiter!\\\" was all he said for a minute, then turning to the\\r\\nwomen with an appealing look that was comically piteous, he added,\\r\\n\\\"Take 'em quick, somebody!  I'm going to laugh, and I shall drop 'em.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJo rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one on each arm,\\r\\nas if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending, while Laurie\\r\\nlaughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It's the best joke of the season, isn't it?  I wouldn't have told you,\\r\\nfor I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter myself I've done\\r\\nit,\\\" said Jo, when she got her breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I never was more staggered in my life.  Isn't it fun?  Are they boys?\\r\\nWhat are you going to name them? Let's have another look.  Hold me up,\\r\\nJo, for upon my life it's one too many for me,\\\" returned Laurie,\\r\\nregarding the infants with the air of a big, benevolent Newfoundland\\r\\nlooking at a pair of infantile kittens.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Boy and girl.  Aren't they beauties?\\\" said the proud papa, beaming\\r\\nupon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Most remarkable children I ever saw.  Which is which?\\\" and Laurie bent\\r\\nlike a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl, French\\r\\nfashion, so you can always tell.  Besides, one has blue eyes and one\\r\\nbrown.  Kiss them, Uncle Teddy,\\\" said wicked Jo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'm afraid they mightn't like it,\\\" began Laurie, with unusual timidity\\r\\nin such matters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Of course they will, they are used to it now.  Do it this minute,\\r\\nsir!\\\" commanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck at each\\r\\nlittle cheek that produced another laugh, and made the babies squeal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"There, I knew they didn't like it!  That's the boy, see him kick, he\\r\\nhits out with his fists like a good one.  Now then, young Brooke, pitch\\r\\ninto a man of your own size, will you?\\\" cried Laurie, delighted with a\\r\\npoke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping aimlessly about.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"He's to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after mother\\r\\nand grandmother.  We shall call her Daisey, so as not to have two Megs,\\r\\nand I suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we find a better name,\\\"\\r\\nsaid Amy, with aunt-like interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Name him Demijohn, and call him Demi for short,\\\" said Laurie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Daisy and Demi, just the thing!  I knew Teddy would do it,\\\" cried Jo\\r\\nclapping her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were 'Daisy' and\\r\\n'Demi' to the end of the chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n          \"FORTY\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable,\\r\\nand tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased\\r\\naffection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of\\r\\ntrouble.  They put away their grief, and each did his or her part\\r\\ntoward making that last year a happy one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth, and in it was\\r\\ngathered everything that she most loved, flowers, pictures, her piano,\\r\\nthe little worktable, and the beloved pussies.  Father's best books\\r\\nfound their way there, Mother's easy chair, Jo's desk, Amy's finest\\r\\nsketches, and every day Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage,\\r\\nto make sunshine for Aunty Beth.  John quietly set apart a little sum,\\r\\nthat he might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with\\r\\nthe fruit she loved and longed for.  Old Hannah never wearied of\\r\\nconcocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears\\r\\nas she worked, and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful\\r\\nletters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands\\r\\nthat know no winter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat Beth,\\r\\ntranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the sweet,\\r\\nunselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave life, she tried to\\r\\nmake it happier for those who should remain behind.  The feeble fingers\\r\\nwere never idle, and one of her pleasures was to make little things for\\r\\nthe school children daily passing to and fro, to drop a pair of mittens\\r\\nfrom her window for a pair of purple hands, a needlebook for some small\\r\\nmother of many dolls, penwipers for young penmen toiling through\\r\\nforests of pothooks, scrapbooks for picture-loving eyes, and all manner\\r\\nof pleasant devices, till the reluctant climbers of the ladder of\\r\\nlearning found their way strewn with flowers, as it were, and came to\\r\\nregard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy godmother, who sat above\\r\\nthere, and showered down gifts miraculously suited to their tastes and\\r\\nneeds.  If Beth had wanted any reward, she found it in the bright\\r\\nlittle faces always turned up to her window, with nods and smiles, and\\r\\nthe droll little letters which came to her, full of blots and gratitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often used to look\\r\\nround, and say \\\"How beautiful this is!\\\" as they all sat together in her\\r\\nsunny room, the babies kicking and crowing on the floor, mother and\\r\\nsisters working near, and father reading, in his pleasant voice, from\\r\\nthe wise old books which seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as\\r\\napplicable now as when written centuries ago, a little chapel, where a\\r\\npaternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn,\\r\\ntrying to show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make\\r\\nresignation possible.  Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls\\r\\nof those who listened, for the father's heart was in the minister's\\r\\nreligion, and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double eloquence\\r\\nto the words he spoke or read.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was well for all that this peaceful time was given them as\\r\\npreparation for the sad hours to come, for by-and-by, Beth said the\\r\\nneedle was 'so heavy', and put it down forever.  Talking wearied her,\\r\\nfaces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own, and her tranquil\\r\\nspirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills that vexed her feeble\\r\\nflesh.  Ah me! Such heavy days, such long, long nights, such aching\\r\\nhearts and imploring prayers, when those who loved her best were forced\\r\\nto see the thin hands stretched out to them beseechingly, to hear the\\r\\nbitter cry, \\\"Help me, help me!\\\" and to feel that there was no help.  A\\r\\nsad eclipse of the serene soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with\\r\\ndeath, but both were mercifully brief, and then the natural rebellion\\r\\nover, the old peace returned more beautiful than ever.  With the wreck\\r\\nof her frail body, Beth's soul grew strong, and though she said little,\\r\\nthose about her felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim\\r\\ncalled was likewise the fittest, and waited with her on the shore,\\r\\ntrying to see the Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed\\r\\nthe river.\\r\\n\\r\\nJo never left her for an hour since Beth had said \\\"I feel stronger when\\r\\nyou are here.\\\"  She slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew\\r\\nthe fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom\\r\\nasked for anything, and 'tried not to be a trouble'.  All day she\\r\\nhaunted the room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being\\r\\nchosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her.  Precious and\\r\\nhelpful hours to Jo, for now her heart received the teaching that it\\r\\nneeded.  Lessons in patience were so sweetly taught her that she could\\r\\nnot fail to learn them, charity for all, the lovely spirit that can\\r\\nforgive and truly forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the\\r\\nhardest easy, and the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts\\r\\nundoubtingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn little book,\\r\\nheard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw her\\r\\nlean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the\\r\\ntransparent fingers, and Jo would lie watching her with thoughts too\\r\\ndeep for tears, feeling that Beth, in her simple, unselfish way, was\\r\\ntrying to wean herself from the dear old life, and fit herself for the\\r\\nlife to come, by sacred words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music\\r\\nshe loved so well.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the saintliest\\r\\nhymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could utter.  For with\\r\\neyes made clear by many tears, and a heart softened by the tenderest\\r\\nsorrow, she recognized the beauty of her sister's life--uneventful,\\r\\nunambitious, yet full of the genuine virtues which 'smell sweet, and\\r\\nblossom in the dust', the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on\\r\\nearth remembered soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible\\r\\nto all.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night when Beth looked among the books upon her table, to find\\r\\nsomething to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as\\r\\nhard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite,\\r\\nPilgrims's Progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in Jo's\\r\\nhand.  The name caught her eye and the blurred look of the lines made\\r\\nher sure that tears had fallen on it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Poor Jo!  She's fast asleep, so I won't wake her to ask leave.  She\\r\\nshows me all her things, and I don't think she'll mind if I look at\\r\\nthis\\\", thought Beth, with a glance at her sister, who lay on the rug,\\r\\nwith the tongs beside her, ready to wake up the minute the log fell\\r\\napart.\\r\\n\\r\\n    MY BETH\\r\\n\\r\\n    Sitting patient in the shadow\\r\\n    Till the blessed light shall come,\\r\\n    A serene and saintly presence\\r\\n    Sanctifies our troubled home.\\r\\n    Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows\\r\\n    Break like ripples on the strand\\r\\n    Of the deep and solemn river\\r\\n    Where her willing feet now stand.\\r\\n\\r\\n    O my sister, passing from me,\\r\\n    Out of human care and strife,\\r\\n    Leave me, as a gift, those virtues\\r\\n    Which have beautified your life.\\r\\n    Dear, bequeath me that great patience\\r\\n    Which has power to sustain\\r\\n    A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit\\r\\n    In its prison-house of pain.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Give me, for I need it sorely,\\r\\n    Of that courage, wise and sweet,\\r\\n    Which has made the path of duty\\r\\n    Green beneath your willing feet.\\r\\n    Give me that unselfish nature,\\r\\n    That with charity divine\\r\\n    Can pardon wrong for love's dear sake--\\r\\n    Meek heart, forgive me mine!\\r\\n\\r\\n    Thus our parting daily loseth\\r\\n    Something of its bitter pain,\\r\\n    And while learning this hard lesson,\\r\\n    My great loss becomes my gain.\\r\\n    For the touch of grief will render\\r\\n    My wild nature more serene,\\r\\n    Give to life new aspirations,\\r\\n    A new trust in the unseen.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Henceforth, safe across the river,\\r\\n    I shall see forever more\\r\\n    A beloved, household spirit\\r\\n    Waiting for me on the shore.\\r\\n    Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,\\r\\n    Guardian angels shall become,\\r\\n    And the sister gone before me\\r\\n    By their hands shall lead me home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they brought\\r\\na look of inexpressible comfort to Beth's face, for her one regret had\\r\\nbeen that she had done so little, and this seemed to assure her that\\r\\nher life had not been useless, that her death would not bring the\\r\\ndespair she feared.  As she sat with the paper folded between her\\r\\nhands, the charred log fell asunder.  Jo started up, revived the blaze,\\r\\nand crept to the bedside, hoping Beth slept.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Not asleep, but so happy, dear.  See, I found this and read it. I knew\\r\\nyou wouldn't care.  Have I been all that to you, Jo?\\\" she asked, with\\r\\nwistful, humble earnestness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"_Oh_, Beth, so much, so much!\\\" and Jo's head went down upon the pillow\\r\\nbeside her sister's.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life.  I'm not so good as you\\r\\nmake me, but I have tried to do right.  And now, when it's too late to\\r\\nbegin even to do better, it's such a comfort to know that someone loves\\r\\nme so much, and feels as if I'd helped them.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"More than any one in the world, Beth.  I used to think I couldn't let\\r\\nyou go, but I'm learning to feel that I don't lose you, that you'll be\\r\\nmore to me than ever, and death can't part us, though it seems to.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I know it cannot, and I don't fear it any longer, for I'm sure I shall\\r\\nbe your Beth still, to love and help you more than ever.  You must take\\r\\nmy place, Jo, and be everything to Father and Mother when I'm gone.\\r\\nThey will turn to you, don't fail them, and if it's hard to work alone,\\r\\nremember that I don't forget you, and that you'll be happier in doing\\r\\nthat than writing splendid books or seeing all the world, for love is\\r\\nthe only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the\\r\\nend so easy.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I'll try, Beth.\\\" and then and there Jo renounced her old ambition,\\r\\npledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging the poverty of\\r\\nother desires, and feeling the blessed solace of a belief in the\\r\\nimmortality of love.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo the spring days came and went, the sky grew clearer, the earth\\r\\ngreener, the flowers were up fairly early, and the birds came back in\\r\\ntime to say goodbye to Beth, who, like a tired but trustful child,\\r\\nclung to the hands that had led her all her life, as Father and Mother\\r\\nguided her tenderly through the Valley of the Shadow, and gave her up\\r\\nto God.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words, see visions,\\r\\nor depart with beatified countenances, and those who have sped many\\r\\nparting souls know that to most the end comes as naturally and simply\\r\\nas sleep.  As Beth had hoped, the 'tide went out easily', and in the\\r\\ndark hour before dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her first\\r\\nbreath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but one loving\\r\\nlook, one little sigh.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters made her\\r\\nready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again, seeing with\\r\\ngrateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced the pathetic\\r\\npatience that had wrung their hearts so long, and feeling with reverent\\r\\njoy that to their darling death was a benignant angel, not a phantom\\r\\nfull of dread.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen morning came, for the first time in many months the fire was out,\\r\\nJo's place was empty, and the room was very still.  But a bird sang\\r\\nblithely on a budding bough, close by, the snowdrops blossomed freshly\\r\\nat the window, and the spring sunshine streamed in like a benediction\\r\\nover the placid face upon the pillow, a face so full of painless peace\\r\\nthat those who loved it best smiled through their tears, and thanked\\r\\nGod that Beth was well at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n          \"TWENTY-SEVEN\\r\\n\\r\\nLITERARY LESSONS\\r\\n\\r\\nFortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good luck penny in her\\r\\npath.  Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt if half a million would\\r\\nhave given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her\\r\\nin this wise.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put on her\\r\\nscribbling suit, and 'fall into a vortex', as she expressed it, writing\\r\\naway at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till that was\\r\\nfinished she could find no peace.  Her 'scribbling suit' consisted of a\\r\\nblack woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a\\r\\ncap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which\\r\\nshe bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action.  This cap\\r\\nwas a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these\\r\\nperiods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads\\r\\nsemi-occasionally to ask, with interest, \\\"Does genius burn, Jo?\\\" They\\r\\ndid not always venture even to ask this question, but took an\\r\\nobservation of the cap, and judged accordingly.  If this expressive\\r\\narticle of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that\\r\\nhard work was going on, in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly\\r\\naskew, and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off,\\r\\nand cast upon the floor.  At such times the intruder silently withdrew,\\r\\nand not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the gifted brow,\\r\\ndid anyone dare address Jo.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe did not think herself a genius by any means, but when the writing\\r\\nfit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon, and led a\\r\\nblissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather, while she sat\\r\\nsafe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends almost as real\\r\\nand dear to her as any in the flesh.  Sleep forsook her eyes, meals\\r\\nstood untasted, day and night were all too short to enjoy the happiness\\r\\nwhich blessed her only at such times, and made these hours worth\\r\\nliving, even if they bore no other fruit.  The divine afflatus usually\\r\\nlasted a week or two, and then she emerged from her 'vortex', hungry,\\r\\nsleepy, cross, or despondent.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was\\r\\nprevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return for\\r\\nher virtue was rewarded with a new idea.  It was a People's Course, the\\r\\nlecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the choice of such a\\r\\nsubject for such an audience, but took it for granted that some great\\r\\nsocial evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding\\r\\nthe glories of the Pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy\\r\\nwith the price of coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying\\r\\nto solve harder riddles than that of the Sphinx.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were early, and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her stocking,\\r\\nJo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who occupied the\\r\\nseat with them.  On her left were two matrons, with massive foreheads\\r\\nand bonnets to match, discussing Women's Rights and making tatting.\\r\\nBeyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the\\r\\nhand, a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an\\r\\nold gentleman taking his preparatory nap behind a yellow bandanna.  On\\r\\nher right, her only neighbor was a studious looking lad absorbed in a\\r\\nnewspaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest her,\\r\\nidly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed\\r\\nthe melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume,\\r\\ntumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two\\r\\ninfuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes,\\r\\nwere stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying\\r\\naway in the background with her mouth wide open.  Pausing to turn a\\r\\npage, the lad saw her looking and, with boyish good nature offered half\\r\\nhis paper, saying bluntly, \\\"want to read it? That's a first-rate story.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nJo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking for\\r\\nlads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love,\\r\\nmystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light\\r\\nliterature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author's\\r\\ninvention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the\\r\\ndramatis personae, leaving the other half to exult over their downfall.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Prime, isn't it?\\\" asked the boy, as her eye went down the last\\r\\nparagraph of her portion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,\\\" returned Jo,\\r\\namused at his admiration of the trash.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could.  She makes a good\\r\\nliving out of such stories, they say.\\\" and he pointed to the name of\\r\\nMrs. S.L.A.N.G.  Northbury, under the title of the tale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Do you know her?\\\" asked Jo, with sudden interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"No, but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in the\\r\\noffice where this paper is printed.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?\\\" and Jo\\r\\nlooked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled\\r\\nexclamation points that adorned the page.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Guess she does!  She knows just what folks like, and gets paid well\\r\\nfor writing it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while\\r\\nProfessor Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and\\r\\nhieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the paper,\\r\\nand boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in its\\r\\ncolumns for a sensational story.  By the time the lecture ended and the\\r\\naudience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself (not\\r\\nthe first founded on paper), and was already deep in the concoction of\\r\\nher story, being unable to decide whether the duel should come before\\r\\nthe elopement or after the murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day, much\\r\\nto the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious when\\r\\n'genius took to burning'.  Jo had never tried this style before,\\r\\ncontenting herself with very mild romances for _The Spread Eagle_.  Her\\r\\nexperience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they gave\\r\\nher some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language, and\\r\\ncostumes.  Her story was as full of desperation and despair as her\\r\\nlimited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to\\r\\nmake it, and having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an\\r\\nearthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement.  The manuscript\\r\\nwas privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that\\r\\nif the tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect,\\r\\nshe would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.\\r\\n\\r\\nSix weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for a girl to\\r\\nkeep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning to give up all\\r\\nhope of ever seeing her manuscript again, when a letter arrived which\\r\\nalmost took her breath away, for on opening it, a check for a hundred\\r\\ndollars fell into her lap.  For a minute she stared at it as if it had\\r\\nbeen a snake, then she read her letter and began to cry.  If the\\r\\namiable gentleman who wrote that kindly note could have known what\\r\\nintense happiness he was giving a fellow creature, I think he would\\r\\ndevote his leisure hours, if he has any, to that amusement, for Jo\\r\\nvalued the letter more than the money, because it was encouraging, and\\r\\nafter years of effort it was so pleasant to find that she had learned\\r\\nto do something, though it was only to write a sensation story.\\r\\n\\r\\nA prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having composed\\r\\nherself, she electrified the family by appearing before them with the\\r\\nletter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that she had won\\r\\nthe prize.  Of course there was a great jubilee, and when the story\\r\\ncame everyone read and praised it, though after her father had told her\\r\\nthat the language was good, the romance fresh and hearty, and the\\r\\ntragedy quite thrilling, he shook his head, and said in his unworldly\\r\\nway...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You can do better than this, Jo.  Aim at the highest, and never mind\\r\\nthe money.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I think the money is the best part of it.  What will you do with such\\r\\na fortune?\\\" asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a\\r\\nreverential eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Send Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month or two,\\\" answered Jo\\r\\npromptly.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo the seaside they went, after much discussion, and though Beth didn't\\r\\ncome home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much better,\\r\\nwhile Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger.  So Jo was\\r\\nsatisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with\\r\\na cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. She\\r\\ndid earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power in the\\r\\nhouse, for by the magic of a pen, her 'rubbish' turned into comforts\\r\\nfor them all.  The Duke's Daughter paid the butcher's bill, A Phantom\\r\\nHand put down a new carpet, and the Curse of the Coventrys proved the\\r\\nblessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.\\r\\n\\r\\nWealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny\\r\\nside, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine\\r\\nsatisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the\\r\\ninspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful\\r\\nblessings of the world.  Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and\\r\\nceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that\\r\\nshe could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.\\r\\n\\r\\nLittle notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market, and\\r\\nencouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for fame\\r\\nand fortune.  Having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to\\r\\nall her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling\\r\\nto three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she\\r\\nwould cut it down one third, and omit all the parts which she\\r\\nparticularly admired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Now I must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold, pay for\\r\\nprinting it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers and get what I can\\r\\nfor it.  Fame is a very good thing to have in the house, but cash is\\r\\nmore convenient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting on this\\r\\nimportant subject,\\\" said Jo, calling a family council.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Don't spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know,\\r\\nand the idea is well worked out.  Let it wait and ripen,\\\" was her\\r\\nfather's advice, and he practiced what he preached, having waited\\r\\npatiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and being in no\\r\\nhaste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"It seems to me that Jo will profit more by taking the trial than by\\r\\nwaiting,\\\" said Mrs. March.  \\\"Criticism is the best test of such work,\\r\\nfor it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults, and help her\\r\\nto do better next time.  We are too partial, but the praise and blame\\r\\nof outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Jo, knitting her brows, \\\"that's just it.  I've been fussing\\r\\nover the thing so long, I really don't know whether it's good, bad, or\\r\\nindifferent.  It will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons\\r\\ntake a look at it, and tell me what they think of it.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I wouldn't leave a word out of it.  You'll spoil it if you do, for the\\r\\ninterest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions of the\\r\\npeople, and it will be all a muddle if you don't explain as you go on,\\\"\\r\\nsaid Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most remarkable\\r\\nnovel ever written.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"But Mr. Allen says, 'Leave out the explanations, make it brief and\\r\\ndramatic, and let the characters tell the story',\\\" interrupted Jo,\\r\\nturning to the publisher's note.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Do as he tells you.  He knows what will sell, and we don't. Make a\\r\\ngood, popular book, and get as much money as you can. By-and-by, when\\r\\nyou've got a name, you can afford to digress, and have philosophical\\r\\nand metaphysical people in your novels,\\\" said Amy, who took a strictly\\r\\npractical view of the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Jo, laughing, \\\"if my people are 'philosophical and\\r\\nmetaphysical', it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such things,\\r\\nexcept what I hear father say, sometimes.  If I've got some of his wise\\r\\nideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for me.  Now,\\r\\nBeth, what do you say?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"I should so like to see it printed soon,\\\" was all Beth said, and\\r\\nsmiled in saying it.  But there was an unconscious emphasis on the last\\r\\nword, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their childlike\\r\\ncandor, which chilled Jo's heart for a minute with a forboding fear,\\r\\nand decided her to make her little venture 'soon'.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born on\\r\\nher table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre.  In the hope of\\r\\npleasing everyone, she took everyone's advice, and like the old man and\\r\\nhis donkey in the fable suited nobody.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously got\\r\\ninto it, so that was allowed to remain though she had her doubts about\\r\\nit.  Her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description.\\r\\nOut, therefore it came, and with it many necessary links in the story.\\r\\nMeg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled up the agony to suit her, while\\r\\nAmy objected to the fun, and, with the best intentions in life, Jo\\r\\nquenched the spritly scenes which relieved the somber character of the\\r\\nstory.  Then, to complicate the ruin, she cut it down one third, and\\r\\nconfidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into\\r\\nthe big, busy world to try its fate.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it,\\r\\nlikewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she\\r\\nexpected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from which it\\r\\ntook her some time to recover.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"You said, Mother, that criticism would help me.  But how can it, when\\r\\nit's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a\\r\\npromising book or broken all the ten commandments?\\\" cried poor Jo,\\r\\nturning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her with\\r\\npride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next.  \\\"This man says,\\r\\n'An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness.' 'All is\\r\\nsweet, pure, and healthy.'\\\" continued the perplexed authoress.  \\\"The\\r\\nnext, 'The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fancies,\\r\\nspiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.' Now, as I had no\\r\\ntheory of any kind, don't believe in Spiritualism, and copied my\\r\\ncharacters from life, I don't see how this critic can be right.\\r\\nAnother says, 'It's one of the best American novels which has appeared\\r\\nfor years.' (I know better than that), and the next asserts that\\r\\n'Though it is original, and written with great force and feeling, it is\\r\\na dangerous book.' 'Tisn't!  Some make fun of it, some overpraise, and\\r\\nnearly all insist that I had a deep theory to expound, when I only\\r\\nwrote it for the pleasure and the money.  I wish I'd printed the whole\\r\\nor not at all, for I do hate to be so misjudged.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHer family and friends administered comfort and commendation liberally.\\r\\nYet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited Jo, who meant so\\r\\nwell and had apparently done so ill.  But it did her good, for those\\r\\nwhose opinion had real value gave her the criticism which is an\\r\\nauthor's best education, and when the first soreness was over, she\\r\\ncould laugh at her poor little book, yet believe in it still, and feel\\r\\nherself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting she had received.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Not being a genius, like Keats, it won't kill me,\\\" she said stoutly,\\r\\n\\\"and I've got the joke on my side, after all, for the parts that were\\r\\ntaken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd,\\r\\nand the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head are pronounced\\r\\n'charmingly natural, tender, and true'.  So I'll comfort myself with\\r\\nthat, and when I'm ready, I'll up again and take another.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "In the cholera example in the textbook, there were multiple cholera outbreaks that killed many people in London in the 1850's. At first people noticed that the air smelled bad around the areas where people died of cholera. There was an association between the bad smell and cholera deaths, and some people came to the conclusion that the air quality (the cause) led to the cholera deaths (the effect).\n",
        "\n",
        "However, Dr. John Snow observed that people who lived next door to each other, and therefore breathing the same air, did not all die from cholera. Looking for a better explanation of the cholera deaths, Dr. Snow mapped the neighborhoods of London and the location of the cholera deaths. The map showed that most of the death locations were close to a particular water pump where people used for their water supply, the Broad Street pump. The map also showed that in other locations of London that used other water pumps, there were very few cholera deaths. There seemed to be an association between using water from the Broad Street pump and cholera.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the map also showed a few death locations that were farther away from the Broad Street pump. Investigation further into these deaths, Dr. Snow found that the people in these far away areas did use water from the Broad Street pump as part of their daily activity, even though they did not live close to it.\n",

        "It seemed that a causality could be established: the water from the Broad Street pump (the cause) led to cholera deaths (the effect). Years later, it was confirmed that the Broad Street well, from which people pumped water, was indeed contaminated with sewage that had been seeping in underground. But at the time of Dr. Snow's investigation, no one knew this.\n",

        "The two water sources were the Lambeth water company and the Southwark & Vauxhall water company. As shown in the [textbook](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/02/2/snow-s-grand-experiment.html), the results were clear: there were almost 10 times more deaths from the area that used Southwark & Vauxhall water than from the area that used Lambeth water. Lambeth's water was drawn from the Thames river at a point that was upriver from where the sewage was released into the river, while Southwark & Vauxhall's water was drawn downriver from where the sewage was released and was contaminated.\n",
